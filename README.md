# My note:
Hi there! This folder contains the project code for the interpreter that I wrote throughout the quarter at UCLA. In the folder, you'll notice four versions of the interpreter and 2 versions of the environment and type_value files, which represent my incremental work on creating the interpreter. "interpreterv4.py", "env_v4.py", and "type_valuev4.py" all represent the final solution that encompasses all the features including, but not limited to dynamic scoping, dynamic typing, first class functions, and prototypal inheritance. 

# Additional Credits:
This project could not have been made possible without the help of my professor, Carey Nachenberg, and his TAs whose solutions were used to write the final solution along with creating the whole environment for testing the interpreter that I wrote. Please refer to the notes below to see specific credits to Professor Nachenberg.

Hey there! This is a template repository that contains the necessary boilerplate for [CS 131](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/fall-23-website/)'s quarter-long project: making an interpreter.
